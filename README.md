# Multi-Step AI Assistant with Gemini & Tavily

This project requires you to develop a **custom AI assistant** (or “agent”) in **Google Colab**, integrating **Gemini** (an advanced LLM), **Tavily** (for data transformation), and an optional search API (e.g., Serper). You will also create a **presentation** to explain your design, code, and results.

---

## 1. Overview

You will build an AI pipeline that:

1. **Receives User Queries** (text input).
2. **Transforms** the queries using Tavily (or similar data-cleaning/transformation tool).
3. Optionally **searches** external sources (e.g., Serper, Google Search API) for real-time data.
4. **Calls Gemini** (a next-generation Large Language Model) to generate the main answer.
   - *If Gemini isn’t publicly available yet, simulate it with another LLM but label it the “Gemini Node.”*
5. Incorporates a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** step to review or approve the AI output (recommended).
6. Outputs the final, refined answer to the user.

All work must be done in a **Google Colab notebook**, and you will **share a public link** to that notebook as part of your submission.

## 2. Key Requirements

1. **Google Colab Notebook**
   - Develop your solution in a single `.ipynb` file hosted on Google Colab.
   - Make sure your notebook is **publicly shareable** (anyone with the link can view or comment).
   - Document each step (Tavily transformation, Gemini calls, optional search, etc.) in markdown cells.

2. **Gemini (LLM Node)**
   - Demonstrate how to integrate or call the Gemini model in code.
   - If Gemini is unavailable, **simulate** with another LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) and label it as the “Gemini Node.”

3. **Tavily (Transformation Node)**
   - Show how Tavily (or another text-processing tool) **preprocesses** or **postprocesses** user input/LLM output.
   - Briefly explain the purpose of each transformation step (e.g., cleaning text, formatting, summarizing).

4. **Optional External Search (Search Node)**
   - If you want real-time or external data, incorporate a search API (e.g., Serper) before calling Gemini.
   - Show how this additional data is integrated into your final prompt or answer.

5. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**
   - Provide a mechanism for **manual approval or review** of the AI output.
   - This could be a code cell that displays the model’s response, then waits for user input (e.g., “approve” or “modify”).

6. **Output**
   - The pipeline should present a final, refined answer after all transformations, external data fetches, and human reviews.

## 3. Deliverables

1. **Google Colab Notebook**
   - A single `.ipynb` file with all your code, markdown explanations, and references.
   - Include examples of **test queries** and the corresponding **AI outputs**.

2. **Presentation**
   - Create a **slide deck** (PowerPoint, Google Slides, or PDF) summarizing:
     - The pipeline diagram (nodes and edges).
     - Code architecture highlights.
     - Sample input-output demonstrations.
     - Reflections on challenges, lessons learned, and next steps.
   - **Tip**: You can use an AI presentation generator (e.g., SlidesAI or Tome.app) if you wish.

3. **Public Link to Colab**
   - Set your Colab notebook sharing to “Anyone with the link can view/comment.”
   - Include this link in your final submission.

4. **Reflection**
   - A short written summary (within the presentation or a separate markdown cell) detailing:
     - Key challenges (technical or conceptual).
     - How you addressed them.
     - Potential future improvements or applications.

## 4. Submission Instructions

1. **Upload Notebook**  
   - Ensure your notebook is saved in Google Colab with a **public share** setting.

2. **Slide Deck**  
   - Provide a link to your Google Slides or other platform (or attach a PDF/PPT file if allowed).

3. **Form or LMS**  
   - You may be required to fill out a Google Form or your course’s LMS assignment page.
   - Paste the **public Colab link** and **presentation link** as directed.

## 5. Suggested Evaluation Criteria

1. **Technical Implementation (30%)**  
   - Does your pipeline run end-to-end?
   - Are Tavily, Gemini, and (optionally) a Search Node used effectively?
   
2. **Pipeline Design & Explanation (20%)**  
   - Clarity of nodes (transform, search, LLM, HITL).
   - Quality of the diagram and how data flows between each step.

3. **Prompt Engineering & AI Output Quality (20%)**  
   - Are prompts well-structured?
   - Does the model handle context or multiple queries logically?

4. **Presentation & Documentation (20%)**  
   - Overall clarity and professionalism of the slide deck.
   - Code comments, markdown explanations, and reflections.

5. **Creativity & Additional Features (10%)**  
   - Implementation of any advanced or creative functionalities (e.g., extended transformations, specialized data sources).
   - Uniqueness of approach or domain focus.

## 6. Timeline (Suggested)

- **Week 1**: Familiarize with Tavily, Gemini (or a stand-in LLM), and optional search APIs.
- **Week 2**: Implement the basic pipeline in Colab (Tavily → Gemini → Output).
- **Week 3**: Add search integration and HITL if desired. Refine code and test.
- **Week 4**: Finalize the notebook, create the presentation, and share via the required channels.
